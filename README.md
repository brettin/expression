Expression Services
================================================

Overview
------------
This service has methods to retrieve data structures for expression samples
(experiments).  These data structures contain the relevant meta data for the
Sample as well as the Log2Level for the features with values.
There is also a method to pull log2level data for a feature across
tha samples that have a measurement for that feature.
